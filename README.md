## What constitutes Proof of Peacemaking?

Proof of Peacemaking is essentially a document exchanged between (at least) two individuals, each possessing distinct identities or identifiers.

These documents may include optional details such as citizenship information (displayed as flags), the organizations issuing and endorsing them, and additional information about co-signers (referred to as peacemakers), such as their names and social media account handles.

Given that all aforementioned details, except names/nicknames, are optional by design, the situation can be understood as follows: co-signers of these bilateral and multilateral agreements by anonymous global citizens.

However, there are caveats: <br>
Similar to other tools focused on individuals, addressing challenges related to proof of personhood and ensuring the uniqueness of individuals within the system are imperative.
